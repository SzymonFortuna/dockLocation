dockLocation

two simple AppleScripts used to change OS X Dock location in two clicks

used by me when plugging in/out an external display

how to install:

1. open in AppleScript Editor
2. export as a script to your default scripts folder /Users/username/Library/Scripts
3. in AppleScript Editor's  preferences toggle the "show scripts menu" switch on
4. find the AppleScript logo near the AirPort switch on a top bar
5. use it! :)

to do:
automatic recognition of plugging the display in/out
